# Rijksgalerij-GING (deployed at)

This front-end application exhibits Dutch masterpieces held by the Rijksgalerij, or Rijks Museum, located in Amsterdam. A user can perform a search of the museum holdings if s/he has a favored Dutch artist.

It was built with React and React-Bootstrap.

This began as a bootcamp assignment that was created by my really wonderful and in-the-stratosphere-smart instructor, [Esin Saribudak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esinsaribudak/). I recently decided to revisit some of my old assignments (some of which were optional so sadly were never completed) to see what I thought of them now that I am several months out from completing the bootcamp. I also didn't think it would hurt to have a refresher on things, like Bootstrap.

This was actually one of the assignments I skipped. It was one of several "choose your own React adventure" and I had chosen a different one. So I spent a good chunk of the day completing this project. It was fun. It was also nice to be able to do it at a leisurely pace and really dig deep on understanding certain features of React and Bootstrap. After completing the project, I spent a little more time with styling. I also added a feature where the user can enter the number of desired search results.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
